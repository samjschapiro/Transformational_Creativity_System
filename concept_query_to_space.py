def get_conceptual_space_from_concept(concept: str, model=None) -> dict:
    prompt = f"""
        You are a world-class conceptual space engineer.

        Given a complex concept, deconstruct and represent its fully fleshed-out conceptual space as a JSON-FORMATTED directed acyclic graph (DAG).

        - Each node corresponds to a component, assumption, or sub-rule used in the construction of the method.
        - Each edge represents a logical or operational dependency: the target node requires the source node to make sense or function.
        - Walks in the graph must terminate at axioms (self-justifying concepts or primitives).
        - Rules are composed from axioms and other rules.

        The output should be a JSON object of the form:
        {{
        "nodes": [
            {{"id": "n1", "label": "Concept Name", "description": "Short summary", "type": "axiom|rule"}},
            ...
        ],
        "edges": [
            {{"source": "n1", "target": "n2", "relation": "depends_on"}},
            ...
        ]
        }}

        Ensure:
        - Axioms are self-justifying; they do not depend on anything
        - Rules are logically downstream from axioms, but the dependency structure of the graph flows towards the axioms.
        - Depends_on structure is strictly maintained
        - Do not treat the high-level concept itself as an axiom unless it's atomic.
        - Be precise and rigorous; no filler.
        - The output contains ONLY JSON
